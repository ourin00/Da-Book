ARC: The Trials
	when they are bonding: "Nonsense. The best beer by far is Rother. it is pricier but you cannot match the taste." "What are you 40? that is something that my dad would say. Look you clearly are disqualified in the future debates about beer. But let me tell you that *goat* is far superior." someone nods. the first person responds "Really? You agree with him. My god." he says it and burst out laughing. and everyone start.
  

Obstacles: 

  

Goals: Our characters want to become Heroes

### **Under lying points in the story:**
### Can dedication to one craft/area give us meaning? 
**Meaning** - One should strive for greatness in one area, that's what gives us meaning. For example being a great chef, surgeon, husband, explorer, etc.. 

PROS
  It keeps you occupied. 
  You have the idea of your potential that you can strive for.
  You are becoming your ideal self. It can be praise worthy. 
  to achieve such mastery over one's craft. 
  we better our self in a certain area. 
  
CONS
  If taken to extremes it can damage your relationships.
  What if you don't succeed(if that is what you desire)? It takes a few hobbies/jobs to find what you want to do. 
  It can be (depending on the area) the most selfish thing to do. Although it can produce good in the society.
  It can turn hobbies into jobs. 
  It can be daunting at first which might make us quit, although if we are truly passionate (and not just motivated) we get through it.

**Friendship** -You are not friends with someone because you can use them, you aren't friends with someone because you enjoy them (although enjoy often follows), you are friends with someone because you mutually **inspire** each other.

**Individualsim** -

**Meaning** - One should strive for greatness in one area, that's what gives us meaning. For example being a great chef, surgeon, husband, explorer, etc..


Overview:

Our characters want to become heroes and so they meet . They travel on a train and see a huge tree, after which they arrive at the first trial. 

  

Random unorganized thoughts:
You are not friends with someone because you can use them, you aren't friends with someone because you enjoy them (although enjoy often follows), you are friends with someone because you mutually inspire each other.
The characters need to bond together, make jokes and learn about each other through the trials! 

  

Poem:

The sacrificial man finds himself in shallow waters. Looking around for water to take from those who are drowning. 


  

The sacrificial man finds himself in deep waters. Looking around for water to take from those who are drowning. Blinded by the good deeds he’s doing. The devil starts planting the seeds of evil in him. 

  

The sacrificial man finds himself drowning. Looking around for help. He can not move nor scream as it would spill the water. The seed of evil grows. Making him resent those people who are blindly looking at him. Yet only the Joker sees the truth from afar.

  

The sacrificial man finds himself suffocating.

The Joker is unable to stop laughing. The passersby went on as usual. The evil seed poisons the waters. From resentment to depression.

  

The sacrificial man finds himself at the Joker’s place. For he sees and fears the evil within him. Begging for the Joker's help. A deal is struck. 

  

The sacrificial man finds himself in the desert. Confused and lost he starts wandering the desert. Resentment, hatred and depression grows more and more. He finds a village in the middle of the desert. Everyone rejects the strange man. 

  

The Sage finds a broken man. Seeing the strange man wandering around. He invites him to his shed. The man asks how to leave the dessert. With a shattered mind there is no leaving
